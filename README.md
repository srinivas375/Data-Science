# Data Science

A comprehensive guide covering essential topics and tools for Data Science, from fundamentals to advanced techniques.

## Audience

This repository is a valuable guide and reference for beginners and intermediate learners, and serves as a quick lookup and revision resource for professionals.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into topic-wise folders, each containing Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts with clear explanations, dataset links, and step-by-step code implementations. It also includes model comparisons and performance analyses across Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects.

**Folders:**

* `1_python_Basics`
* `2_Maths`
* `3_EDA`
* `4_Frontend` (Streamlit, Gradio)
* `5_Backend` (FastAPI)
* `6_Machine_Learning` (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)
* `7_Deep_Learning`
* `8_OpenCV`
* `9_NLP`

Each folder contains:

* 70+ Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with formatted markdown, step-by-step code, and explanations
* 50+ Python scripts (`.py`) with understandable comments
* Dataset download links
* ML & DL model comparisons
* Models performance analyses
* Different tasks implementations according to domain/topic

## Installation

First clone the Repostiory using:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/srinivas375/Data-Science.git
  ```
Then navigate to `Data Science` folder
### Using `uv`

1. Install `uv`:

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```
3. Activate the environment:

   * **Windows:**

     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * **Linux/macOS:**

     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv install
   ```

### Using `pip`

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv_name
   ```
2. Activate the environment:

   * **Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv_name\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * **Linux/macOS:**

     ```bash
     source venv_name/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
